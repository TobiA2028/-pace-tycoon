## Backstory
We are four freshmen at Rice University (Richa, Tobi, Aaron, and Bryan) participating in a Hackathon on the first-timers track. 
We wanted to create something exciting and fun for our first hackathon, and were inspired by Houston's space history, which led to the idea of building a space-themed video game, 
combining space exploration with financial decision-making. Our game, **Space Tycoon**, blends the thrilling action of dodging asteroids and collecting stars 
with the long-term strategy of managing your earnings.

## What it does
In **$pace Tycoon**, you play as a pilot hired by a billionaire space tycoon to test their rocket. Your goal is to navigate through the asteroid belt, 
collecting shooting stars to earn money while avoiding asteroids that will cost you money. You control the rocket using the left and right arrow keys, 
but you're not aloneâ€”an AI-controlled pilot will compete with you to earn more money. Whoever earns the most money wins! 
There's also a website but code isn't included here.
